I've reorganised the files.

This directory is where your code should go; the other directories are:

Core    - modules for internal functionality
Plugin  - optional modules; these will generally implement an interface with something external
Utility - related to Core; these are modules that are useful, but don't actually produce results
configs - where your config files should go
